# HandCubeSolver

HandCubeSolver is a Python-based project that allows you to solve a virtual Rubik's Cube using hand gestures. With this application, you can manipulate a 3D Rubik's Cube on your computer screen by moving your hands in front of a camera. It provides an interactive and fun way to solve the classic puzzle.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Virtual 3D Rubik's Cube on your computer screen.
- Intuitive gesture controls for cube rotations and movements.
- Automatic solving of the Rubik's Cube when completed.
- Easy-to-use and interactive interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the 'Requirements' section.
3. Run the main script to start the application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions for hand gesture controls.
5. Solve the Rubik's Cube by moving your hands!

## How It Works

HandCubeSolver uses computer vision techniques to detect and track your hand movements in real-time. It recognizes predefined hand gestures and translates them into corresponding Rubik's Cube movements. The virtual cube's state is continuously updated as you make gestures.
